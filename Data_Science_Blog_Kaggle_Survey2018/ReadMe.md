### Data Science Blog on Kaggle Survey 2018 ###

Kaggle recently conducted its second annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey 2018. Total of 23,859 responses were received. 
You can learn more about here at this link https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2018/home

This repository contains three files:
1. Notebook - All the implementation has been done here.
2. html - its the downlaoded version of Notebook
3. zip file - it does have the dataset.

A blog has been written by me on Medium and here is the link https://medium.com/@rajat.gupta11.10/this-will-make-you-start-into-the-field-of-data-science-44307fe4b6ae

This blog is written specially for those who want to enter into the field of Data Science. It gives answer to 5 important questions which are listed here:
1. How people are learning? — Self study, Online courses etc
2. How is the quality of Online Courses or In-Person Bootcamps as compared to traditional brick and mortar institutions?
3. Which programming language is recommended to learn first?
4. Which Online platform is most popular to learn Data Science or Machine Learning?
5. Which media sources should be followed that report on Data Science?

#### Motivation behind this blog/project ####
This is the first time I wrote any blog on Data Science. It actually took me weeks to first finalize the topic and then write a blog on it. I am glad that Udacity has this blog writing project as part of Nanodegree, otherwise, I would not have written for public.

#### Libraries used to perform the analysis ####
- NumPy
- Pandas 
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Warnings

#### Conclusion: ####

- It can be concluded that Self-Learning is anyway necessary whether you opt for Online Courses or Work. 
- As per responses, Online Learning Courses quality is better than the Brick and Mortar Institutions so you can feel safe and choose Online Courses.
- Python is the most recommended programming language followed by R. As per my experience, it is better to have SQL knowledge also.
- Coursera is the most popular Online Learning Platform for Data Science and Machine Learning. But as per my experience, you should choose between Coursera and Udacity.
- You must follow Medium Blogs and Siraj Raval YouTube Channel.
