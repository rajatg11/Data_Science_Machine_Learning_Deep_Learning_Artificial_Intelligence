## TV Script Generation Project Overview

This project is part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.

Welcome to the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) project in the Deep Learning Nanodegree! In this project, we'll generate your own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. We'll be using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network we'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.
