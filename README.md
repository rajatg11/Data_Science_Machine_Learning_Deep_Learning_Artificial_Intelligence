### 1. Finding Donors for CharityML (Supervised ML)
  This Project is part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree
 #### Project Description
  With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML wants to build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead  cost of sending mail. The goal is to evaluate and optimize several different `supervised learners` to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.

### 2. Flowers Image Classifier Project (CNN)
  This Project is part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.
#### Project Description
  We'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. Imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice we'd train this classifier, then export it for use in an application. We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories and train it using `PyTorch`.

### 3. Dog Breed Image Classifier (CNN)
 This Project is part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.
#### Project Description
  We will make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app. At the end of this project, the code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

### 4. TV Script Generation (RNN)
This Project is part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.
#### Project Description
In this project, we'll generate our own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. We'll be using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network we'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

### 5. Face Generation (GANs)
This project is part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree
#### Project Overview
In this project, we'll use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.

### 6. Teach a Quadcopter How to Fly (Deep Reinforcement Learning)
This Project is part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree
#### Project Overview
The Quadcopter or Quadrotor Helicopter is becoming an increasingly popular aircraft for both personal and professional use. Its maneuverability lends itself to many applications, from last-mile delivery to cinematography, from acrobatics to search-and-rescue.

In this project, you will design your own reinforcement learning task and an agent to complete it. 

### 7. Predicting Student Admissions with Neural Networks in Keras (Neural Network)
This Mini-Project is part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree
#### Project Overview
This project is to predict student admissions to graduate school at UCLA based on three pieces of data:
1. GRE Scores (Test)
2. GPA Scores (Grades)
3. Class rank (1-4)

### 8. Predict Bike Sharing Data (Neural Network)
This Mini-Project is part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree
#### Project Overview
Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions,
precipitation, day of week, season, hour of the day, etc. can affect the rental behaviors. The core data set is related to  
the two-year historical log corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA which is 
publicly available in http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data. We aggregated the data on two hourly and daily basis and then 
extracted and added the corresponding weather and seasonal information. Weather information are extracted from http://www.freemeteo.com. 

### Regression: 
Predication of bike rental count hourly or daily based on the environmental and seasonal settings.
