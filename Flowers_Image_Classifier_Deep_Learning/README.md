# Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project

This project is divided into 2 parts : 
1. Develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch.
2. Convert it into a command line application.

### Requirements 

Completing the project is likely not possible on your local unless you have a GPU.

### Data

The data for this project is quite large - in fact, it is so large we cannot upload it onto Github.  If you would like the data for this project, you will want download it from the workspace in the classroom. You will be training using 102 different types of flowers, where there ~20 images per flower to train on.  Then you will use your trained classifier to see if you can predict the type for new images of the flowers.

So, we will be using [this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flowers.

### Project Files
#### 1. Image Classfier Project.ipynb ####
  This is the notebook where the project was developed in first part. You can also see the prediction at the bottom of the notebook that it has predicted the flower.
#### 2. Image Classfier Prokect.html ####
  This html file is basically a report/downloaded html version of noteboook.
#### 3. cat_to_name.json ####
  This json file contains the mapping of flower category to flower name. For example, in the data you will see 102 folders of flower images and these folders name are like 1 2 3...102. 
  So, we need some mapping whcih can tell us that folder 1 belogs to which flower.
#### 4. train.py ####
  This file contains the code which is used to train the images
#### 5. predict.py ####
 This file contains the code for flower prediction.
#### 6. Readme.md ####
Its this file.
